# Files

Files is a Rust-powered native desktop file manager built with Tauri.

The goal of this project is to explore Rust systems design, clean architecture, and native desktop application development.

This repository documents the engineering journey from a pure Rust core to a fully integrated desktop application.

---

## Architecture (Planned)

- Core logic written in Rust (filesystem engine, state management, selection logic)
- Thin UI layer powered by Tauri
- Clear IPC boundaries between frontend and backend
- Native OS interaction patterns

Work in progress.
